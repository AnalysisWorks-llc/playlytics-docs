# Lineup Builders

Playlytics includes two lineup builders — Defensive Lineup and Batting Lineup — each using player performance data to make data-driven suggestions.

## Defensive Lineup Builder

The defensive lineup builder suggests optimal defensive alignments based on each player's fielding percentage at each position.

**How it works:**
1. Navigate to **Lineups → Defensive Lineup**
2. The algorithm fills positions using a priority spine: C → P → SS → 2B → 3B → 1B → CF → LF → RF
3. Players are placed at their strongest position based on FLD% data
4. Override any position by tapping it and selecting a different player
5. Locked manual selections are preserved when the lineup auto-updates

**Reading the suggestion:**
Each position shows the suggested player with their FLD% at that position. The overall defensive grade updates as you make changes.

**Availability tracking:**
Mark players as unavailable before building the lineup. Reasons include injury, absence, rest, pitch count limit, or other. Unavailable players are excluded from suggestions.

## Batting Lineup Builder

The batting lineup builder suggests batting order based on OBP (leadoff), power, and speed metrics.

**How it works:**
1. Navigate to **Lineups → Batting Lineup**
2. The algorithm places the highest OBP player in the leadoff spot
3. Remaining spots are filled based on a balance of power and contact metrics
4. Drag and drop players to reorder the lineup
5. The stat comparison panel shows key metrics for each player

**Sparklines:**
Each player card shows a mini trend chart of recent at-bat results — a quick visual of current form.

**Saving lineups:**
Save any lineup configuration for future reference. Saved lineups appear in your lineup history.

## Combined Game Day Card
